# How to contribute cookbooks

At the moment this the first iteration of our Cookbook index, so we have bootstrapped it with a manual process. We plan to make the index more fully featured and automated over time.

## Add your own Cookbooks to the Index

You can manage your cookbooks in your own GitHub repositories. Either as repos dedicated to cookbooks, or as part of a project (e.g. in the project's `.sensei` folder)

This allows you to manage any changes to the cookbook via pull requests.

To add them to this index. Either:

1. Raise an issue with a link to the GitHub repo and some details about what it does and we will manually create the index listing for you.
2. Create a pull request on the main `readme.md` with a listing entry for your Cookbook
3. Create a `.zip` file for your Cookbook and send it to us by creating an 'issue', we will manually add the `.zip` to our download archive and create a listing for you.


## Add Recipes to Existing Cookbooks

If there is a Cookbook in the listing that you believe you have a recipe which is a good fit, then:

1. If it is a GitHub hosted Cookbook then you can raise a pull request on the appropriate repo and add your recipe.
2. If it doesn't fit into any existing Cookbook then raise an issue with the recipe details, and potentially some example code that it matches and we'll create a Cookbook to add it to.
3. If it is for a `download.zip` only repo then raise an issue with the recipe details, and we'll add it to a Cookbook
