    <p id="abstract">Logging any issues is considered a best practice. Making a logger available in every class reduces the threshold to use logging.</p>
    <br>
    <p id="impact_and_desired_state">Logging errors, warnings and other debugging information ensures that the information does not get lost. Centralised logging with multiple error levels enables you to have a clear overview of any issues in the application.</p>
