  name: 'Exception: Created but not thrown'
  shortDescription: Exceptions should be thrown, not just created
  level: error
  language: java
  scwCategory: ""
  enabled: true
  comment: This recipe only addresses the case of an instance creation that is not
    thrown, assigned or used in any other way. The other ways are detected and marked
    by IntelliJ itself? Also, do we need target self in the QF?
