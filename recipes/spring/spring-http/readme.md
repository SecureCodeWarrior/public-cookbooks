## Spring Http Cookbook
A cookbook that simplifies development with the Spring Http package. It aims to automate common routines
performed by developers, preventing them to repeat themselves or introduce known issues.

It covers the following protections:
<ul>
<li>Injection: XXE: Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter#setProcessExternalEntities set to true</li>
<li>Injection: XXE: Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter#setSupportDtd set to true</li>
<li>Injection: XXE: SourceHttpMessageConverter#setProcessExternalEntities set to true</li>
<li>Injection: XXE: SourceHttpMessageConverter#setSupportDtd set to true</li>
</ul>
