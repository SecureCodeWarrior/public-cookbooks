## Spring Security Cookbook
A cookbook that simplifies Spring Security development. It aims to automate common routines
performed by developers, preventing them to repeat themselves or introduce known issues.

It covers the following protections:
<ul>
<li>Protection against CSRF by setting HttpOnly flag to true</li>
<li>Include subdomains in the HSTS domain</li>
<li>Enforce HSTS protection against vulnerabilities over HTTP</li>
</ul>
