<h2>Abstract</h2>Enforce HSTS protection against vulnerabilities over HTTPS
<h2>Description</h2>Disabling <code>httpStrictTransportSecurity()</code> makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker could enforce the use of HTTP, which could allow communication to be intercepted and read.
By enabling <code>httpStrictTransportSecurity()</code>, the application will communicate over HTTPS.
