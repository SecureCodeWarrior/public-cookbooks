<h2>Abstract</h2>Setting <code>includeSubDomains()</code> to true makes sure that subdomains will also be treated as an HSTS domain. This is a default setting in Spring Security.
<h2>Description</h2>Cookies can be manipulated from sub-domains, so omitting the <code>includeSubDomains()</code> option permits a broad range of cookie-related attacks that HSTS would otherwise prevent by requiring a valid certificate for a subdomain. Ensuring the secure flag is set on all cookies will also prevent, some, but not all, of the same attacks.
By using the default setting, or explicitly setting <code>includeSubDomains()</code> to true, will instruct Spring Security to treat the subdomains as part of the HSTS domain.
