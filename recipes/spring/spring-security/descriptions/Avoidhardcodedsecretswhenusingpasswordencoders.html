Storing passwords or other secrets in plain text in the source code is a huge security risk. As credentials are frequently reused, a hacker, with access to the repository with hardcoded credentials, could use this information to compromise other systems/applications. Another possible scenario is that the code could end up being published, making the credentials publicly available to anyone.

If a secret really needs to be stored, make use of environment variables.
