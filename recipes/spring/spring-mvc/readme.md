## Spring MVC Cookbook
A cookbook that simplifies Spring MVC development. It aims to automate common routines
performed by developers, preventing them to repeat themselves or introduce known issues.

It covers the following protections:
<ul>
<li>Specify RequestMapping method</li>
<li>Avoid mapping to multiple HTTP request methods</li>
<li>Use composed requestmapping annotations</li>
<li>Use requestMapping on public methods</li>
</ul>
