## Spring Oxm Cookbook
A cookbook that simplifies development with Spring Object/XML Marshalling development. It aims to automate common routines
performed by developers, preventing them to repeat themselves or introduce known issues.

It covers the following protections:
<ul>
<li>Injection: XXE: Jaxb2Marshaller#setProcessExternalEntities set to true</li>
<li>Injection: XXE: Jaxb2Marshaller#setSupportDtd set to true</li>
</ul>
