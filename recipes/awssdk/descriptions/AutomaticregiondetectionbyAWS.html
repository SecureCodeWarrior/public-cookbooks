<h2>Description</h2>
When deploying your application to multiple regions, and when running AWS Lambda or Amazon EC2, it might be easier to allow AWS to automatically determine the region for you. 

However, keep in mind that if a region is not explicitly set, and AWS is unable to determine it, the client creation will fail.

<b>Before</b>
<pre>Region newRegion = Region.US_EAST_1;
     Ec2Client ec2 = Ec2Client.builder()
                .region(newRegion)
                .build();</pre>
<b>After</b>
<pre>Region newRegion = Region.US_EAST_1;
        Ec2Client ec2 = Ec2Client.create();</pre>
