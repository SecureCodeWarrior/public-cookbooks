<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Out of Android best practices and secure coding guidelines, recommendations were abstracted that state that sensitive data should be stored in a private location, inaccessible from other applications</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Developers must ensure that sensitive information is written to a private location which is inaccessible by other applications.
One solution is to write data to the internal storage of the device instead of the external storage.<br/>
The following code example shows how to create a file on the internal storage. A flag should be set to ensure that the file can only be accessed by the current application. To ensure good code quality it is recommended to use a meaningful constant for this flag instead of its raw value.</p>
