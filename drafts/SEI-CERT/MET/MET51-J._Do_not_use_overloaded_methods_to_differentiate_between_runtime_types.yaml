  name: MET51-J. Do not use overloaded methods to differentiate between runtime types
  shortDescription: <p>Java supports overloading methods and can distinguish between
    methods with different signatures. Consequently, with some qualifications, methods
    within a class can have the same name if they have different parameter lists.
    In method overloading, the method to be invoked at runtime is determined at compile
    time. Consequently, the overloaded method associated with the static type of the
    object is invoked even when the runtime type differs for each invocation.</p>
