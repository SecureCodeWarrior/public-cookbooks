  name: MET54-J. Always provide feedback about the resulting value of a method
  shortDescription: <p>Methods should be designed to return a value that allows the
    developer to learn about the current state of the object and/or the result of
    an operation. This advice is consistent with <a class="external-link" href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/EXP00-J.+Do+not+ignore+values+returned+by+methods"
    rel="nofollow">EXP00-J. Do not ignore values returned by methods</a>. The returned
    value should be representative of the last known state and should be chosen keeping
    in mind the perceptions and mental model of the developer.</p>
