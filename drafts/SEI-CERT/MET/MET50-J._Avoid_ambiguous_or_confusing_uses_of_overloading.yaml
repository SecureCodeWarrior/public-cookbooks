  name: MET50-J. Avoid ambiguous or confusing uses of overloading
  shortDescription: <p>Method and constructor overloading allows declaration of methods
    or constructors with the same name but with different parameter lists. The compiler
    inspects each call to an overloaded method or constructor and uses the declared
    types of the method parameters to decide which method to invoke. In some cases,
    however, confusion may arise because of the presence of relatively new language
    features such as autoboxing and generics.</p>
