  name: JNI03-J. Do not use direct pointers to Java objects in JNI code
  shortDescription: <p>If a direct pointer to a Java object is used then erroneous
    results may be obtained that could lead to the code crashing. This, in turn, could
    be used to mount a denial of service attack.&nbsp; In some circumstances, the
    direct pointer could become a "dangling pointer" which could result in sensitive
    information being leaked or malicious execution of arbitrary code.</p>
