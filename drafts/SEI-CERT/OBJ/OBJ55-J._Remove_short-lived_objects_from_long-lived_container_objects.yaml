  name: OBJ55-J. Remove short-lived objects from long-lived container objects
  shortDescription: <p>Always remove short-lived objects from long-lived container
    objects when the task is over. For example, objects attached to a <code>java.nio.channels.SelectionKey</code>
    object must be removed when they are no longer needed. Doing so reduces the likelihood
    of memory leaks. Similarly, use of array-based data structures such as <code>ArrayList</code>
    can introduce a requirement to indicate the absence of an entry by explicitly
    setting <code>ArrayList</code>'s individual array elements to <code>null</code>.</p>
