  name: OBJ05-J. Do not return references to private mutable class members
  shortDescription: <p>Returning references to internal object state (mutable or immutable)
    can render an application susceptible to information leaks and corruption of its
    objects' states, which consequently violates class <a href="/confluence/display/java/Rule+BB.+Glossary#RuleBB.Glossary-invariant">invariants</a>.
    Control flow can also be affected in some cases.</p>
