  name: OBJ57-J. Do not rely on methods that can be overridden by untrusted code
  shortDescription: <p>Untrusted code can misuse APIs provided by trusted code to
    override methods such as&nbsp;<code>Object.equals()</code>,&nbsp;<code>Object.hashCode()</code>,
    and&nbsp;<code>Thread.run()</code>. These methods are valuable targets because
    they are commonly used behind the scenes and may interact with components in a
    way that is not easily discernible.</p>
