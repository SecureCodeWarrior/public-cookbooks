  name: OBJ58-J. Limit the extensibility of classes and methods with invariants
  shortDescription: <p>Java classes and methods may have <em><a href="/confluence/display/java/Rule+BB.+Glossary#RuleBB.Glossary-invariant">invariants</a></em>.
    An invariant is a property that is assumed to be true at certain points during
    program execution but is not formally specified as true. Invariants may be used
    in <code>assert</code> statements or may be informally specified in comments.</p>
