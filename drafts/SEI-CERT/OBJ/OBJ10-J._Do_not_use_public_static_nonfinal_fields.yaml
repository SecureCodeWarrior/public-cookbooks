  name: OBJ10-J. Do not use public static nonfinal fields
  shortDescription: <p>Unauthorized modifications of public static variables can result
    in unexpected behavior and violation of class <a href="/confluence/display/java/Rule+BB.+Glossary#RuleBB.Glossary-invariant">invariants</a>.
    Furthermore, because static variables can be visible to code loaded by different
    class loaders when those class loaders are in the same delegation chain, such
    variables can be used as a covert communication channel between different application
    domains.</p>
