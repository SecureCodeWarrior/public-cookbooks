  name: OBJ51-J. Minimize the accessibility of classes and their members
  shortDescription: <p>Classes and class members (classes, interfaces, fields, and
    methods) are access-controlled in Java. The access is indicated by an access modifier
    (<code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, or <code>private</code>) or by the
    absence of an access modifier (the default access, also called <em>package-private
    access</em>).</p>
