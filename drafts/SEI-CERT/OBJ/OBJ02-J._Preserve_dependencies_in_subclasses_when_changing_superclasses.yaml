  name: OBJ02-J. Preserve dependencies in subclasses when changing superclasses
  shortDescription: <p>Modifying a superclass without considering the effect on subclasses
    can introduce <a href="/confluence/display/java/Rule+BB.+Glossary#RuleBB.Glossary-vulnerabi">vulnerabilities</a>.
    Subclasses that are developed with an incorrect understanding of the superclass
    implementation can be subject to erratic behavior, resulting in inconsistent data
    state and mismanaged control flow. Also, if the superclass implementation changes
    then the subclass may need to be redesigned to take into account these changes.</p>
