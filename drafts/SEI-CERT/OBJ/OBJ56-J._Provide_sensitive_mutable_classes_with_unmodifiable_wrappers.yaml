  name: OBJ56-J. Provide sensitive mutable classes with unmodifiable wrappers
  shortDescription: <p>Immutability of fields prevents inadvertent modification as
    well as malicious tampering so that defensive copying while accepting input or
    returning values is unnecessary. However, some sensitive classes cannot be immutable.
    Fortunately, read-only access to mutable classes can be granted to untrusted code
    using unmodifiable wrappers. For example, the <code>Collection</code> classes
    include a set of wrappers that allow clients to observe an unmodifiable view of
    a <code>Collection</code> object.</p>
