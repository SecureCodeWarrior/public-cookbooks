  name: OBJ52-J. Write garbage-collection-friendly code
  shortDescription: "<p>Java'\x80\x99s garbage-collection feature provides significant\
    \ benefits over non-garbage-collected languages. The garbage collector (GC) is\
    \ designed to automatically reclaim unreachable memory and to avoid memory leaks.\
    \ Although the GC is quite adept at performing this task, a malicious attacker\
    \ can nevertheless launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack against the GC, such\
    \ as by inducing abnormal heap memory allocation or abnormally prolonged object\
    \ retention. For example, some versions of the GC could need to halt all executing\
    \ threads to keep up with incoming allocation requests that trigger increased\
    \ heap management activity. System throughput rapidly diminishes in this scenario.</p>"
