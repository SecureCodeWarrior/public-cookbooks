  name: OBJ53-J. Do not use direct buffers for short-lived, infrequently used objects
  shortDescription: <p>The new I/O (NIO) classes in <code>java.nio</code> allow the
    creation and use of direct buffers. These buffers tremendously increase throughput
    for repeated I/O activities. However, their creation and reclamation is more expensive
    than the creation and reclamation of heap-based nondirect buffers because direct
    buffers are managed using OS-specific native code. This added management cost
    makes direct buffers a poor choice for single-use or infrequently used cases.
    Direct buffers are also outside the scope of Java's garbage collector; consequently,
    injudicious use of direct buffers can cause memory leaks. Finally, frequent allocation
    of large direct buffers can cause an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>.</p>
