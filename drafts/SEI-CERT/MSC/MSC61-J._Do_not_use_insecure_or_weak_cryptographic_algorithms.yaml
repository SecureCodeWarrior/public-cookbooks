  name: MSC61-J. Do not use insecure or weak cryptographic algorithms
  shortDescription: <p>Security-intensive applications <em>must</em> avoid use of
    insecure or weak cryptographic primitives to protect sensitive information. The
    computational capacity of modern computers permits circumvention of such cryptography
    via brute-force attacks. For example, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption
    algorithm is considered highly insecure; messages encrypted using DES have been
    decrypted by brute force within a single day by machines such as the Electronic
    Frontier Foundation's (EFF) Deep Crack.</p>
