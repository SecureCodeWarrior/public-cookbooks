  name: MSC55-J. Use comments consistently and in a readable fashion
  shortDescription: <p>Mixing the use of traditional or block comments (starting with
    <code>/*</code> and ending with <code>*/</code>) and end-of-line comments (from
    <code>//</code> to the end of the line) can lead to misleading and confusing code,
    which may result in errors.</p>
