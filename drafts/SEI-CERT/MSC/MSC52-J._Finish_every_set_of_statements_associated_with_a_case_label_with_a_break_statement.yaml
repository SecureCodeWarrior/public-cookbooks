  name: MSC52-J. Finish every set of statements associated with a case label with
    a break statement
  shortDescription: <p>A <code>switch</code> block comprises several <code>case</code>
    labels and an optional but highly recommended <code>default</code> label. Statements
    that follow each <code>case</code> label must end with a <code>break</code> statement,
    which is responsible for transferring the control to the end of the <code>switch</code>
    block. When omitted, the statements in the subsequent <code>case</code> label
    are executed. Because the <code>break</code> statement is optional, omitting it
    produces no compiler warnings. When this behavior is unintentional, it can cause
    unexpected control flow.</p>
