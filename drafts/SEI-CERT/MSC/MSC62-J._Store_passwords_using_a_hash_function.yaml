  name: MSC62-J. Store passwords using a hash function
  shortDescription: <p>Programs that store passwords as cleartext (unencrypted text
    data) risk exposure of those passwords in a variety of ways. Although programs
    generally receive passwords from users as cleartext, they should ensure that the
    passwords are not stored as cleartext.</p>
