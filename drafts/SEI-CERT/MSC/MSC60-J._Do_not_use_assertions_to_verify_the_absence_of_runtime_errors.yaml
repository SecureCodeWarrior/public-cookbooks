  name: MSC60-J. Do not use assertions to verify the absence of runtime errors
  shortDescription: <p>Diagnostic tests can be incorporated into programs by using
    the <code>assert</code> statement.&nbsp;Assertions are primarily intended for
    use during debugging and are often turned off before code is deployed by using
    the <code>-disableassertions</code> (or <code>-da</code>) Java&nbsp;runtime switch.
    Consequently, assertions should be used to protect against incorrect programmer
    assumptions and not for runtime error checking.</p>
