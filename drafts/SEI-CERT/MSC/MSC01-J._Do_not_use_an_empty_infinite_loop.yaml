  name: MSC01-J. Do not use an empty infinite loop
  shortDescription: <p>An infinite loop with an empty body consumes CPU cycles but
    does nothing. Optimizing compilers and just-in-time systems (JITs) are permitted
    to (perhaps unexpectedly) remove such a loop. Consequently, programs must not
    include infinite loops with empty bodies.</p>
