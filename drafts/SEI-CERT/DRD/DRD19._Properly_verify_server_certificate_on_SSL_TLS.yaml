  name: DRD19. Properly verify server certificate on SSL/TLS
  shortDescription: <p>Not properly verifying the server certificate on SSL/TLS may
    allow apps to connect to an imposter site, while fooling the user into thinking
    that the user is connected to an intended site. One example of associated risks
    is that this&nbsp;could expose a user's sensitive data.</p>
