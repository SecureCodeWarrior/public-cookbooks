  name: DRD10-X. Do not release apps that are debuggable
  shortDescription: <p>Releasing an app with its <code>android:debuggable</code> attribute
    set to <code>true</code> can leak sensitive information. In addition, the app
    is vulnerable to decompilation, resulting in alteration to source code.Attackers
    can leverage the additional information they gain from debugging output to mount
    attacks targeted on the framework, database, or other resources used by the application.</p>
