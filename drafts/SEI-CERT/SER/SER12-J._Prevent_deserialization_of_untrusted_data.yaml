  name: SER12-J. Prevent deserialization of untrusted data
  shortDescription: <p>Whether a violation of this rule is exploitable depends on
    what classes are on the JVM's classpath.&nbsp; (Note that this is a property of
    the execution environment, not of the code being audited.) In the worst case,
    it could lead to remote execution of arbitrary code.</p>
