  name: CON52-J. Document thread-safety and use annotations where applicable
  shortDescription: <p>The Java language annotation facility is useful for documenting
    design intent. Source code annotation is a mechanism for associating metadata
    with a program element and making it available to the compiler, analyzers, debuggers,
    or Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for examination. Several annotations are available
    for documenting thread-safety or the lack thereof.</p>
