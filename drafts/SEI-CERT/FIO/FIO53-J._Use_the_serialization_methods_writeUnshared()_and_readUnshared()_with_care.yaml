  name: FIO53-J. Use the serialization methods writeUnshared() and readUnshared()
    with care
  shortDescription: <p>When objects are serialized using the <code>writeObject()</code>
    method, each object is written to the output stream only once. Invoking the <code>writeObject()</code>&nbsp;method
    on the same object a second time places a back-reference to the previously serialized
    instance in the stream. Correspondingly, the <code>readObject()</code> method
    produces at most one instance for each object present in the input stream that
    was previously written by <code>writeObject().</code></p>
