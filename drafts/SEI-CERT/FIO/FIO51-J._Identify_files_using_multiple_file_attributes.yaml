  name: FIO51-J. Identify files using multiple file attributes
  shortDescription: <p>Many file-related security vulnerabilities result from a program
    accessing an unintended file object. This often happens because file names are
    only loosely bound to underlying file objects. File names provide no information
    regarding the nature of the file object itself. Furthermore, the binding of a
    file name to a file object is reevaluated each time the file name is used in an
    operation. This reevaluation can introduce a time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU)
    race condition into an application. Objects of type&nbsp;<code>java.io.File</code>&nbsp;and
    of type&nbsp;<code>java.nio.file.Path</code>&nbsp;are bound to underlying file
    objects by the operating system only when the file is accessed.</p>
