  shortDescription: '<p>A Java security policy grants permissions to code to allow
    access to specific system resources. A <em>code source</em> (an object of type&nbsp;<code>CodeSource</code>),
    to which a permission is granted, consists of the code location (URL) and a reference
    to the certificate(s) containing the public key(s) corresponding to the private
    key(s) used to digitally sign the code. Reference to the certificate(s) is pertinent
    only if the code was digitally signed. A <em>protection domain</em> encompasses
    a <code><span>CodeSource</span></code><span style="font-family: Courier New;">&nbsp;</span>
    and the permissions granted to code from that <code><span>CodeSource</span></code>,
    as determined by the security policy currently in effect. Consequently, classes
    signed by the same key and originating from the same URL are placed in the same
    protection domain. A class belongs to one and only one protection domain. Classes
    that have the same permissions but are from different code sources belong to different
    domains.</p>'
