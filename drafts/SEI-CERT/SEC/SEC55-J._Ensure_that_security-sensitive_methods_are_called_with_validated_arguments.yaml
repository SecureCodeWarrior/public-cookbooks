  name: SEC55-J. Ensure that security-sensitive methods are called with validated
    arguments
  shortDescription: <p>Application code that calls security-sensitive methods must
    validate the arguments being passed to the methods. In particular,&nbsp;<code>null</code>
    values may be interpreted as benign by certain security-sensitive methods but
    may override default settings. Although security-sensitive methods should be coded
    defensively, the client code must validate arguments that the method might otherwise
    accept as valid. Failure to do so can result in privilege escalation and execution
    of arbitrary code.</p>
