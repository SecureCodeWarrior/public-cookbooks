  name: SEC52-J. Do not expose methods that use reduced-security checks to untrusted
    code
  shortDescription: <p>Most methods lack security manager checks because they do not
    provide access to sensitive parts of the system, such as the file system. Most
    methods that do provide security manager checks verify that every class and method
    in the call stack is authorized before they proceed. This security model allows
    restricted programs, such as Java applets, to have full access to the core Java
    library. It also prevents a sensitive method from acting on behalf of a malicious
    method that hides behind trusted methods in the call stack.</p>
