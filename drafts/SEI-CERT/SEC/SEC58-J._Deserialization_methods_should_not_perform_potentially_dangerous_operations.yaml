  name: SEC58-J. Deserialization methods should not perform potentially dangerous
    operations
  shortDescription: <p>The severity of violations of this rule depend on the nature
    of the potentially dangerous operations performed.&nbsp; If only mildly dangerous
    operations are performed, the risk might be limited to denial-of-service (DoS)
    attacks.&nbsp; At the other extreme, remote code execution is possible if attacker-supplied
    input is supplied to methods such as <code>Runtime.exec</code> (either directly
    or via reflection).</p>
