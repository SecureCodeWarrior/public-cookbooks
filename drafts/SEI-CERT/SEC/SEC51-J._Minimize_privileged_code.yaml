  name: SEC51-J. Minimize privileged code
  shortDescription: <p>Programs must comply with the principle of least privilege
    not only by providing privileged blocks with the minimum permissions required
    for correct operation (see <a href="/confluence/display/java/SEC50-J.+Avoid+granting+excess+privileges">SEC50-J.
    Avoid granting excess privileges</a>) but also by ensuring that privileged code
    contains <em>only</em> those operations that require increased privileges. Superfluous
    code contained within a privileged block must operate with the privileges of that
    block, increasing the attack surface.</p>
