  name: DCL51-J. Do not shadow or obscure identifiers in subscopes
  shortDescription: <p>Reuse of identifier names in subscopes leads to obscuration
    or shadowing. Reused identifiers in the current scope can render those defined
    elsewhere inaccessible. Although the <em>Java Language Specification</em> (JLS)
    [<a href="/confluence/display/java/Rec.+AA.+References#Rec.AA.References-JLS11">JLS
    2013</a>] clearly resolves any syntactic ambiguity arising from obscuring or shadowing,
    such ambiguity burdens code maintainers and auditors, especially when code requires
    access to both the original named entity and the inaccessible one. The problem
    is exacerbated when the reused name is defined in a different package.</p>
