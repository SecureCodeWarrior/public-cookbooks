  name: DCL53-J. Minimize the scope of variables
  shortDescription: <p>Scope minimization helps developers avoid common programming
    errors, improves code readability by connecting the declaration and actual use
    of a variable, and improves maintainability because unused variables are more
    easily detected and removed. It may also allow objects to be recovered by the
    garbage collector more quickly, and it prevents violations of <a href="/confluence/display/java/DCL51-J.+Do+not+shadow+or+obscure+identifiers+in+subscopes">DCL51-J.
    Do not shadow or obscure identifiers in subscopes</a>.</p>
