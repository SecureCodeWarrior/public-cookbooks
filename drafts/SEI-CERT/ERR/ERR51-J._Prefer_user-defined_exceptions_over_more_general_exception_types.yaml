  name: ERR51-J. Prefer user-defined exceptions over more general exception types
  shortDescription: <p>Because an exception is caught by its type, it is better to
    define exceptions for specific purposes than to use the general exception types
    for multiple purposes. Throwing general exception types makes code hard to understand
    and maintain and defeats much of the advantage of the Java exception-handling
    mechanism.</p>
