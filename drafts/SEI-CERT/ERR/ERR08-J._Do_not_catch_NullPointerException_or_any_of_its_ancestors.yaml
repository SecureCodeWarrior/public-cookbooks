  name: ERR08-J. Do not catch NullPointerException or any of its ancestors
  shortDescription: <p>Catching <code>NullPointerException</code> may mask an underlying
    null dereference, degrade application performance, and result in code that is
    hard to understand and maintain. Likewise, catching <code>RuntimeException</code>,
    <code>Exception</code>, or <code>Throwable</code> may unintentionally trap other
    exception types and prevent them from being handled properly.</p>
