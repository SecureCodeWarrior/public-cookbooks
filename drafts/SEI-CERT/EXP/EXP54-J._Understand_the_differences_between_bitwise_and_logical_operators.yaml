  name: EXP54-J. Understand the differences between bitwise and logical operators
  shortDescription: <p>The conditional AND and OR operators (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>
    and <code>||</code> respectively) exhibit short-circuit behavior. That is, the
    second operand is evaluated only when the result of the conditional operator cannot
    be deduced solely by evaluating the first operand. Consequently, when the result
    of the conditional operator <em>can</em> be deduced solely from the result of
    the first operand, the second operand will remain unevaluated; its side effects,
    if any, will never occur.</p>
