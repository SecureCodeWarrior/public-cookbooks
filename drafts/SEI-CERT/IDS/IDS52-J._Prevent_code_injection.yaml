  name: IDS52-J. Prevent code injection
  shortDescription: <p>Code injection can occur when untrusted input is injected into
    dynamically constructed code. One&nbsp;obvious source of potential vulnerabilities
    is the use of JavaScript from Java code.&nbsp;The <code>javax.script</code> package
    consists of interfaces and classes that define Java scripting engines and a framework
    for the use of those interfaces and classes in Java code. Misuse of the <code>javax.script</code>
    API permits an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.</p>
