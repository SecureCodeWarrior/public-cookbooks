  name: IDS54-J. Prevent LDAP injection
  shortDescription: <p>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) allows an
    application to remotely perform operations such as searching and modifying records
    in directories. LDAP injection results from inadequate input sanitization and
    validation and allows malicious users to glean restricted information using the
    directory service.</p>
