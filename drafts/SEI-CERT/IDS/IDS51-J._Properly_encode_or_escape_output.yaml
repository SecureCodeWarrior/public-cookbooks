  shortDescription: <p>Proper input sanitization can prevent insertion of malicious
    data into a subsystem such as a database. However, different subsystems require
    different types of sanitization. Fortunately, it is usually obvious which subsystems
    will eventually receive which inputs, and consequently what type of sanitization
    is required.</p>
