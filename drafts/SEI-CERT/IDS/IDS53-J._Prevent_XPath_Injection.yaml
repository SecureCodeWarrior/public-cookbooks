  name: IDS53-J. Prevent XPath Injection
  shortDescription: <p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) can be used for data storage
    in a manner similar to a relational database. Data is frequently retrieved from
    such an XML document using XPaths.&nbsp;<em>XPath injection</em>&nbsp;can occur
    when data supplied to an XPath retrieval routine to retrieve data from an XML
    document is used without proper sanitization. This attack is similar to SQL injection
    or XML injection (see <a class="external-link" href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/IDS00-J.+Sanitize+untrusted+data+passed+across+a+trust+boundary"
    rel="nofollow">IDS00-J. Sanitize untrusted data passed across a trust boundary</a>).
    An attacker can enter valid SQL or XML constructs in the data fields of the query
    in use. In typical attacks, the conditional field of the query resolves to a tautology
    or otherwise gives the attacker access to privileged information.</p>
