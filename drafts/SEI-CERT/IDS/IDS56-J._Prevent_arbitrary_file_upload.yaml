  name: IDS56-J. Prevent arbitrary file upload
  shortDescription: <p>Java applications, including web applications, that accept
    file uploads must ensure that an attacker cannot upload or transfer malicious
    files. If a restricted file containing code is executed by the target system,
    it can compromise application-layer defenses. For example, an application that
    permits HTML files to be uploaded could allow malicious code to be executedâ€”an
    attacker can submit a valid HTML file with a cross-site scripting (XSS) payload
    that will execute in the absence of an output-escaping routine. For this reason,
    many applications restrict the type of files that can be uploaded.</p>
