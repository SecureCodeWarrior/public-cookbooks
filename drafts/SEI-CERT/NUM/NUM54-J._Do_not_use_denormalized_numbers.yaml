  name: NUM54-J. Do not use denormalized numbers
  shortDescription: <p>Floating-point numbers are an approximation; denormalized floating-point
    numbers are a less precise approximation. Use of denormalized numbers can cause
    unexpected loss of precision, possibly leading to incorrect or unexpected results.
    Although the severity for violations of this rule is low, applications that require
    accurate results should make every attempt to comply.</p>
