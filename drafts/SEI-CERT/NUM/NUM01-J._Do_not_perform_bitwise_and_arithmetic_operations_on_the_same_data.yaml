  name: NUM01-J. Do not perform bitwise and arithmetic operations on the same data
  shortDescription: <p>Performing bitwise manipulation and arithmetic operations on
    the same variable obscures the programmer's intentions and reduces readability.
    Consequently, it is more difficult for a security auditor or maintainer to determine
    which checks must be performed to eliminate <a href="/confluence/display/java/Rule+BB.+Glossary#RuleBB.Glossary-securityflaw">security
    flaws</a> and ensure data integrity. For instance, overflow checks are critical
    for numeric types that undergo arithmetic operations but less critical for numeric
    types that undergo bitwise operations.</p>
