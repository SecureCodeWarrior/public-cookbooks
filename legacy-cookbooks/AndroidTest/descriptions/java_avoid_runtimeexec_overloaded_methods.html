<h2>Abstract</h2>
Secure coding practices prescribe to avoid running OS commands from the program.
<h2>Description</h2>
It is not recommended to use the java <code>Runtime.exec(String)</code> method. The overloaded method <code>Runtime.exec(String[])</code> is secure as long as no user input is used in the first String in the array. However, it is best practice to avoid running OS commands from the program altogether. Use API calls whenever possible.
