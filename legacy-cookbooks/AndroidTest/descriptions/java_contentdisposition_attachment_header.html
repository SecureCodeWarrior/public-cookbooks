<h2>Abstract</h2>
Secure coding practices prescribe to set the Header Content-Disposition to include "attachement".
<br/>
<h2>Description</h2>
It is recommended to add the "Content-Disposition: Attachment" header to the response of static files, as this will secure the website against Flash or PDF-based cross-site content-hijacking attacks. 
It is recommended that this practice be performed for all files that users need to download in all modules that deal with file downloads.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Correct code example:</b><br/>
<pre>
response.setHeader("<b>Content-Disposition</b>","<b>attachment</b>; filename=\"" + file + "\""); </b>
</pre>
<br/>
