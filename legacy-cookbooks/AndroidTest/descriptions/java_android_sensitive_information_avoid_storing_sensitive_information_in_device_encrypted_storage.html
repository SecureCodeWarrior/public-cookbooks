<h2>Abstract</h2>
Out of best practices and Android coding guidelines, recommendations were abstracted which state that storing sensitive information in device encrypted storage is unsafe.
<h2>Description</h2>
<i>Device Encrypted storage</i> should not be used to store sensitive information. It's a less secure storage location than the <i>Credential Encrypted Storage</i>. This latter location is only available after the user has unlocked their device. The <i>Credential Encrypted Storage</i> is the default storage location, so no extra configuration is needed.
<h4>Correct code example:</h4>
<pre>
String filename = "myfile";
String string = "output";
FileOutputStream outputStream;
try {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputStream = contextObject.openFileOutput(filename, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputStream.write(string.getBytes());
} catch (Exception e) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e//handle Exception
} finally {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputStream.close();
}
</pre>

 4. The security implications when doing it wrong, information for developer interested in security 
<h2>Additional security information</h2>
A device running Android 7.0 (Nougat) will start in a secure, <i>Direct Boot</i> mode until the device is unlocked. In this mode, only the <i>Device Encrypted storage</i> is available. Once the device is unlocked, the <i>Credential Encrypted Storage</i> becomes available as well.

The <i>Device Encrypted Storage</i> can be used to store information such as schedules and user notifications. As mentioned before, sensitive information should not be stored in this location.
