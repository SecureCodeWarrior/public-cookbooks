<h2>Abstract</h2>
Out of Android best practices and secure coding guidelines, recommendations were abstracted that state that sensitive data should be stored in a private location, inaccessible from other applications.
<h2>Description</h2>
Developers must ensure that sensitive information is written to a private location which is inaccessible by other applications.
One solution is to write data to the internal storage of the device instead of the external storage.<br/>
The following code example shows how to create a file on the internal storage. A flag should be set to ensure that the file can only be accessed by the current application. To ensure good code quality it is recommended to use a meaningful constant for this flag instead of its raw value.
<h4>Correct code example:</h4>
<pre>
FileOutputStream fos;
File file = new File(filepath) ;
Context c = this.getApplicationContext();
fos = c.openFileOutput(file.getPath(), android.content.Context.<b>MODE_PRIVATE</b>);
</pre>
