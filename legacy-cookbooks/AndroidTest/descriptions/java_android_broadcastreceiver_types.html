<h3>Broadcast Receiver Types</h3>
Based on tags and attributes used in activities, three types can be specified: private, in-house and
public.
<ol>
    <li><b>Private Broadcast Receiver: Only receives broadcasts from the same application.</b><br>

<pre>
&lt;receiver android:exported="<b>false</b>" .../&gt;
</pre>
    </li>
    <li><b>In-House Broadcast Receiver: Receives all broadcasts that pass through the intent filter.</b><br> These are broadcasts that are meant for this receiver and the sending app has permission.
<pre>
&lt;receiver android:exported="<b>true</b>" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;android:<b>permission="com.senseisecurity.inhousereceiver.BROADCAST_PERMISSION"</b> /&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;intent-filter&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;action android:name="com.senseisecurity.broadcast.MY_BROADCAST_INHOUSE" /&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;intent-filter /&gt;
&lt;/receiver &gt;
</pre>
 Example on how to define and use the permission:
<pre>
&lt;permission
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;android:name="com.senseisecurity.broadcast.inhousereceiver.BROADCAST_PERMISSION"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;android:protectionLevel="signature" /&gt;
&lt;uses-permission
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspandroid:name="com.senseisecurity.broadcast.inhousereceiver.BROADCAST_PERMISSION" /&gt;
</pre>
    </li>
    <li><b>Public Broadcast Receiver: Receives all broadcasts without filtering.</b><br>
        Similar to the In-House broadcast receiver, but without <code>android:permission</code>.<br/>
        <em><u>Security implications for public broadcast receivers</u>:  Public broadcast receivers as may give unauthorized
        applications access to private information. Public receivers can receiver broadcasts from any applications, so they can
        also receive broadcasts from malware. Instead developers should use In-house receivers, so that the apps require
        permission and the user has control over what app can potentially access his data.</em>
    </li>
</ol>
