<h2>Abstract</h2>
Secure coding practices prescribe to use strong password policies.
<h2>Description</h2>
Many systems use passwords to authenticate the user. It is recommended to use strong password policies to prevent password guessing, brute forcing and other attacks. A good policy includes:
<ul>

<li>A good <b>minimum and maximum password length</b>. Short passwords have insufficient entropy and are more easily guessed. Long password lengths can lead to DOS. A reasonable password length is between 10 and 160 characters.</li>

<li><b>Do not limit the character set</b>. This is often done to prevent SQL injection or other input validation attacks. Protect against these attacks with proper input escaping instead of limiting the character set. A limited character set facilitates password brute forcing and guessing.</li>

<li><b>Passwords may not contain personal information.</b> This makes password guessing easier.</li>

<li><b>Passwords may not be reused.</b> If passwords, protected or unprotected, leak from a third party, reusing of passwords will make it possible for an attacker to successfully authenticate with the leaked credentials.</li>

<li><b>Expiration of passwords is recommended in sensitive context.</b></li>

<li><b>Display a generic message when any of the credentials are incorrect</b>. Do not specify whether the username or the password is incorrect to prevent username enumeration. </li>
<li>It is recommended to force the user of your application to create a <b>strong password</b>. It is recommended to force a user to use at least:

<ul>
<li> One upper case character</li>
<li>One lower case character</li>
<li>One numeric character</li>
</ul>
A common practice is to indicate password strength to the user through a combination of measures such as length and sufficient entropy in the used characters.
</li>
</ul>
