<h3>Service Types</h3>
Based on tags and attributes used in services, four types can be specified: private, public, partner and in-house.
<ol>
    <li><b>Private Service: Can only receive intents from the App itself.</b>
<pre>
&lt;service android:exported="<b>false</b>" ... /&gt;
</pre>
    </li>
    <li><b>Partner Service: Can only receive explicit intents from a white-list of partner apps.</b><br>
        Does not define an intent filter and does not use the attribute <code>android:permission</code>.
<pre>
&lt;service android:exported="<b>true</b>" ... /&gt;
</pre>
    </li>
    <li><b>In-House Service: Can only receive explicit intents from apps that have the right permission.</b><br>
        Does not define an intent filter.
<pre>
&lt;service android:exported="<b>true</b>"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;android:<b>permission</b>="com.senseisecurity.service.inhouseservice.SERVICE_PERMISSION" /&gt;
</pre>
    </li>
    <li><b>Public Service.</b><br>
 <i><u>Security implications for public services</u>: Public services as may give unauthorized applications access to private information. Public
        services have the <code>android:exported</code> attribute set to true and define an intent filter, this means that they can be used
        by any applications, so they can also be used by malware. Instead developers should use In-house services, so that the
        apps require permission and the user has control over what app can potentially access his data. Or developers can use
        partner services so that they can whitelist apps to use their service.
    </li>
</ol>

If an application can bind to your service it might gain unauthorized access to data. The adversary could also
perform unauthorized tasks. Links:<br>
