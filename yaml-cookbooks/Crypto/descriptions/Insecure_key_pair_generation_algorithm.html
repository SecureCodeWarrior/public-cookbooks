    <p id="impact_and_desired_state">Asymmetric encryption requires a pair of keys, a private and a public key. This enables authenticity on top of confidentiality in the encryption algorithm. Authenticity is a requirement for some secure communication channels. That means that asymmetric cryptography is typically used in a scheme for signatures or a key agreement and not for bulk encryption of data. It is recommended to use RSA for key pair generation.</p>

    <b>Correct code example</b>
<pre>keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(<b>"RSA"</b>);</pre>
