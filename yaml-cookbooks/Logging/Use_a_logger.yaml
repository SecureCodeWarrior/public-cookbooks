  name: Use a logger
  shortDescription: Printing messages directly to the standard output is considered
    a bad practice. It's recommended to use a logger instead. A logger can be turned
    on/off, it provides different levels of logging and can be controlled through
    a configuration file or environment variables. Some advanced logger provides allow
    you to configure log file rotation, purging and tune it for multi-threading purposes.
