    <p>The Android best practices and secure coding guidelines make recommendations stating sensitive data should be stored in a private location, inaccessible from other applications</p>
    <br>
    <p>Developers must ensure that sensitive information is written to a private location which is inaccessible by other applications. One solution is to write data to the internal storage of the device instead of the external storage.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The following code example shows how to create a file on the internal storage. A flag should be set to ensure that the file can only be accessed by the current application. To ensure good code quality it is recommended to use a meaningful constant for this flag instead of its raw value.</p>
    <br>
    <b>Before</b>
<pre>SharedPreferences sharedPreferences =
    getSharedPreferences("customer_data", Context.MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE);</pre>
    <br>
    <b>After</b>
<pre>SharedPreferences sharedPreferences =
    getSharedPreferences("customer_data", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);</pre>
