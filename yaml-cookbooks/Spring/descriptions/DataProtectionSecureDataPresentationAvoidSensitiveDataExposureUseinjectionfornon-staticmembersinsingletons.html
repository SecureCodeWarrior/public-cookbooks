<h2>Abstract</h2>
Secure coding practices prescribe that non-static members in singletons should be injected.
<h2>Description</h2>
In Spring <code>@Controller</code>, <code>@Service</code>, and <code>@Repository</code> classes are singletons by default. This means that only one instance of the class is ever instantiated in the application. Typically such a class will have a few <code>static</code> members, such as a logger. However, non-static members should be managed by Spring. This can be done with one of the following annotations:
<pre>
org.springframework.beans.annotation.<b>Autowired</b>
org.springframework.beans.annotation.<b>Value</b>
javax.inject.<b>Inject</b>
javax.annotation.<b>Resource</b>
</pre>
Having non-injected members in one of these classes could indicate an attempt to manage state. Since these classes are singletons, managing statehis is likely to expose information of one user's session to another user.
Use these functions as follows.
<h4>Correct code example:</h4>
<pre>
@Controller
public class SensitiveDataExposure {

    @Autowired
    private String name = null;

    @GetMapping("/greet")
    public String greet (String greetee){
        if (greetee != null){
            this.name = greetee;
        }
        return "Hello " + this.name;
    }
}
</pre>
