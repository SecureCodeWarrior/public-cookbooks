<p>Out of best practices and Android coding guidelines, recommendations were abstracted which state that <code>SQLCipher</code> should be preferred over SQLite databases.</p>
<br>
<p><code>SQLCipher</code> offers a fully-encrypted database. It is very easy to implement in your application as <code>SQLCipher</code> offers their own implementation of the SQLite methods. A downside of <code>SQLCipher</code> is a slight performance decrease, as well as the need to securely store the encryption key. Thus, <code>SQLCipher</code> can be used if the key can be supplied by the user of the application (e.g., a pin or password), or if the key can be securely sent over the network to the application. Never store the encryption key in the application itself!</p>
